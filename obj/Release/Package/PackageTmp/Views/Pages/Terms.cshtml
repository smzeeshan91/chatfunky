    <h1>Chatfunky Terms of Service</h1>

    <h3>We Are Different</h3>
    <p>
        You have seen many online live chat websites or apps but we are different from them. Just get addicted to use our service
        and you will know it :)
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        We are using highly efficient live communication mechanism which allows a user to send and receive messages efficiently and instantly.
        Also our service will let you know about your internet connectivity and logout automatically in case of internet disconnects.
    </p>

    <h3>Moderation Job</h3>
    <p>
        Moderation is a job  of responsibility. Hence you must use your moderator rights in appropriate manner.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        If a moderator utilizes any illegal use of moderator rights (i.e kicking users without any purpose etc.), it will result in a
        suspension of account and permanent IP (Internet Protocol) ban.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        If you want to become a site moderator, you should contact to admin at <b>chatfunky.service@@gmail.com</b> or send message through 'wonna
        add something?' section on footer.
    </p>

    <h3>Use of Vulgar Words</h3>
    <p>
        Use of any kind of vulgar words or spreading vulgarity on our website will result in kick and ban for about some time.
    </p>

    <h3>The Future</h3>
    <p>
        We are very small enough right now, but soon we will be the biggest online communication industry/network on this planet.
    </p>
